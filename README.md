May it be a file, stdin, or a network connection, I will always need a way to read content line by line. This function does exactly that.

- Parameters:	
  * #1. file descriptor for reading
  * #2. the value of what has been read
- Return value:	
  * 1 : a line has been read
  * 0 : EOF has been reached
  * -1 : an error occured
